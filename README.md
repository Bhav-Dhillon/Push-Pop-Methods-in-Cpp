# FILO - Push & Pop

### Project Description
Stack .push() and .pop() methods for adding/removing data from a first in, last out data structure. The methods are written using classes, pointers, and nodes. I undertook this exercise to gain a lower-level understanding, specifically about memory and pointers. C++ was chosen due to its ability to work with the object-oriented paradigm, classes were used here to implement the data structure.
