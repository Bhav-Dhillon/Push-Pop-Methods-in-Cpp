# Push & Pop Functions 

### Project Description
Stack push and pop methods used to add/remove data from an array. The methods are written using classes, pointers, and nodes. I undertook this project to get a lower level understanding of programming, specifically about memory and pointers. C++ was chosen due to it's ability to work with OOP, as classes were used to create the required data structures.
