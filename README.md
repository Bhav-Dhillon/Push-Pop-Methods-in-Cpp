# Push & Pop Functions 

### Project Description
- This was my first project. It is simply the creation of push and pop functions used to add/remove data from an array. The functions are written using stacks, pointers, and nodes. I undertook this project to get a lower level understanding of programming. C++ was chosen due to it's ability to work with OOP, as I used classes here to create both the nodes and the stack.
