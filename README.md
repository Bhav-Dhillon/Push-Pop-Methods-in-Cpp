# Push & Pop Functions 

### Project Description
Stack .push() and .pop() methods for adding/removing data from a first in, last out data structure. The methods are written using classes, pointers, and nodes. I undertook this project to get a lower level understanding of programming, specifically about memory and pointers. C++ was chosen due to it's ability to work with OOP, classes were used here to create the  data structure.
